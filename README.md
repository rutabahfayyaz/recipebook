This project is a Recipe Book, a front-end Angular application, that is primarily based on two core modules i.e the recipes section and the shopping-list section. In the recipes section, the user is able to browse through a list of recipes comprising their images, description, and ingredients. If desired, more recipes can be added and modified or deleted as desired. 
Now you must be wondering what's the purpose of a shopping-list in a Recipe Book? 
Whilst browsing the recipes, the user might as well be thinking about what next to make for lunch or dinner. So there the user can easily move the ingredients of a particular recipe into the shopping-list.  So, the shopping-list is solely there to remind the user about the ingredients to purchase when users next visit the mart.
